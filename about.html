I am Sahiti. 
I am a Computer Science Engineer by education and Designer at heart.
</p>
<p>
  I did bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering.
  I have been intersted in arts and crafts right from my childhood. That has naturally slid my heart towards graphic design.
</p>

<p>
You can generally see me fiddling with my laptop creating few eye-hurting graphics.
</p>
<p>
While I am free, you can notice me  bursting peoples eardrums with my songs. 
Oh! Did I mention that I am a classical singer?
