I am Sahiti. 
I am a Computer Science Engineer by education and Designer at heart.
</p>
<p>
  I did bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from Ramachandra College of Engineering, Eluru. 
I have been intersted in arts and crafts right from my childhood. That has naturally slid my heart towards graphic design.
</p>

<p>
You can generally see me fiddling with my laptop creating few eye-hurting graphics.
</p>
<p>
While I am free, you can notice me make bursting peoples eardrums with my songs. 
Oh! Did I mention that I am a classical singer?
</p>
<p>
Warning: Navigate to the other parts of this website at your own risk. I am not responsible for any broken hearts or burst eyes or both! Lol!!
<p>
Jokes apart, I love designing interfaces those are easy to use and are a candy to eyes. 
</p>
<p>
My goal is to make sure that the users do not think while using interfaces that I design. My contentment with an app design is inversely proportional to amount of brain activity a user has while consuming that app.
