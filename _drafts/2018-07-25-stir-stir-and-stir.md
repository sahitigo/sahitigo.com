When was the last time I entered the kitchen with the motive of cooking you ask me, that's one dificult question to answer. Somehow nothing could ever inspire me,seriously nothing, not even my mom's constant nudging. As they say ,the way to a person's heart is through their stomach,the only way I could find the way to my kitchen is through my hunger. It is the only thing that could motivate me.

#### **Why did this happen?**

Like every other day, after an hour of my lunch am hungry again. I was searching for everything in  the house hoping to find something interesting(even though knowing that I wouldn't find any).Then all of a sudden I remembered the receipe my mom has sent me over whatsapp.Mysore pak,the Indian sweet prepared in ghee,that is popular in southern India,as the intenet calls. Then this strange craving started,which naturally made me to venture this.

#### **And how??**

The first thing I did was to ensure if I had everything the reciepe said.

1   cup	-	Besan

1   cup	-	Sugar

1   cup	-	Ghee

1/2 cup	-	Water

Everything in equal amounts. First thing to do is put everything you need ready ,next to you.

Then,fry the besan on low flame for 2-3 minutes,and put it aside.

Next take 1/2 cup of water,add sugar and stir it and make sugarsyrup.

Now,carefully add besan to it and keep stirring.

Finally add ghee to it and again keep stirring. (Stir,as if there's no stop.)

At a point you see the bubbles and the whole batter hardening.

Apply ghee to a plate,and transfer it ontoit.

Set it aside for 30 - 60 minutes.To let it cool down.

Tada,you're all set to eat.
