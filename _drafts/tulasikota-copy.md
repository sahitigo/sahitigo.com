Tulasi kota :  
That's the spot in my favourite place. My ammammma's house. A place which saw me grow. The area where we used to cycle,play cricket and had tuitions.Am very much greatful to my grandmother for the effort and pain she took in nurturing us. For the values she taught us. She is the binding force in the family. Whatever we are today is because of the good roots and family.Â
